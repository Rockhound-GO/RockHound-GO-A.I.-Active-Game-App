        luster: "Vitreous",
        crystalSystem: "Trigonal",
        description: "Amethyst is a popular and well-known variety of quartz. Its purple color is due to irradiation, iron impurities, and the presence of trace elements. It is a semiprecious stone and the traditional birthstone for February. Amethyst is found in many locations around the world, with the largest deposits in Brazil and Uruguay."

        crystalSystem: "Trigonal",
        description: "Rose Quartz is a pink variety of quartz, with its color attributed to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese. It is often found in massive form and rarely forms distinct crystals. Known as the 'Stone of Unconditional Love', it's a very popular gemstone for jewelry and ornamentation."

        luster: "Waxy",
        crystalSystem: "Trigonal (Cryptocrystalline)",
        description: "Agate is a common rock formation, consisting of chalcedony and quartz as its primary components, consisting of a wide variety of colors. Agates are primarily formed within volcanic and metamorphic rocks. The ornamental use of agate was common in ancient Greece and it is used as a semiprecious stone."

        name: "Celestine",
        formula: "SrSO₄",
        hardness: "3-3.5",
        luster: "Vitreous",
        crystalSystem: "Orthorhombic",
        description: "Celestine, or Celestite, is a mineral consisting of strontium sulfate. The mineral is named for its occasional delicate blue color. Celestine occurs as crystals, and also in compact massive and fibrous forms. It is principally found in sedimentary rocks, particularly in the cavities of sandstone and limestone."

        name: "Sandstone",
        formula: "N/A (Compositional)",
        hardness: "6-7",
        luster: "Dull",
        crystalSystem: "N/A (Sedimentary Rock)",
        description: "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized mineral particles or rock fragments. Most sandstone is composed of quartz and/or feldspar because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface. Sandstone is a popular building material from ancient times."

        name: "Shale",
        formula: "N/A (Compositional)",
        hardness: "3",
        luster: "Dull",
        crystalSystem: "N/A (Sedimentary Rock)",
        description: "Shale is a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock, composed of mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite. The defining characteristic of shale is its fissility, a tendency to split into thin layers."

        name: "Geode",
        formula: "N/A (Formation)",
        hardness: "Varies (often 7)",
        luster: "Varies",
        crystalSystem: "Varies",
        description: "Geodes are geological rock formations which occur in sedimentary and certain volcanic rocks. They are hollow, vaguely spherical rocks, in which masses of mineral matter (which may include crystals) are secluded. The crystals are formed by the filling of vesicles in volcanic and sub-volcanic rocks by minerals deposited from hydrothermal fluids."

        name: "Beryl",
        formula: "Be₃Al₂(SiO₃)₆",
        hardness: "7.5-8",
        luster: "Vitreous",
        crystalSystem: "Hexagonal",
        description: "Beryl is a mineral composed of beryllium aluminium cyclosilicate. The hexagonal crystals of beryl can be of considerable size. Well-known varieties of beryl include emerald (green), aquamarine (blue), morganite (pink), and heliodor (golden). These varieties are distinguished by their color and are among the most valuable gemstones."
